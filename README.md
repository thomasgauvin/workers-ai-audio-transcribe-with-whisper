# Workers AI Whisper Demo

Simple demo of using Workers AI with Whisper. This converts your audio file to base64 in the browser/`index.html`, send it to the API.

I wanted something super simple, but check out [@craigdennis](https://github.com/craigsdennis)'s [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df04laN8Y3s) for an implementation on [Astro](https://astro.build/).
